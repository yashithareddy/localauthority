      <h2 class="card-title">Challenges faced by the council due to late tax payments </h2>
      <p class="card-text">Late tax payments present significant challenges for the council, impacting the effective delivery of essential public services and jeopardizing the financial stability of the local government. One of the primary challenges is the strain on the council's budget and cash flow. Late tax payments disrupt revenue projections and cash flow management, making it difficult for the council to meet its financial obligations, including the funding of public services, infrastructure projects, and employee salaries. This can lead to budgetary deficits, increased borrowing costs, and potential service cutbacks, compromising the quality and availability of services for residents. late tax payments undermine the council's ability to plan and invest in long-term community development initiatives. Uncertainty surrounding revenue collection hampers strategic planning efforts and inhibits the implementation of essential projects aimed at improving infrastructure, promoting economic growth, and enhancing the overall quality of life in the community. Additionally, delayed tax receipts may force the council to prioritize immediate financial needs over critical investments in areas such as education, healthcare, and environmental conservation, hindering progress and sustainable development.</p>
