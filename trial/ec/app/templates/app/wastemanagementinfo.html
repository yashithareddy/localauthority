      <h2 class="card-title">Understanding Waste Management</h2>
      <p class="card-text">Waste management is the process of collecting, transporting, treating and disposing of waste in a safe
        and environmentally friendly way.Waste management also involves reducing, reusing and recycling waste as much as possible to conserve
        natural resources and save energy.Waste disposal is becoming more difficult and costly due to the scarcity of land, water and energy
        resources and the stricter environmental regulations and standards.Waste represents a loss of valuable resources that could be reused or recycled to create new products or
        materials or to generate energy, reducing the dependence on non-renewable and imported resources.Waste management is a legal obligation and a social responsibility for all waste generators and handlers,
        as well as a moral duty for all citizens, to ensure the sustainability and well-being of current and future
        generations.At Waste Management Inc., we are committed to preserving the environment and promoting sustainability through effective waste management practices.

        </p>
        <h2 class="card-title">Challenges of Waste Management</h2>
        <p class="card-text"> Economic growth, urbanization, industrialization and consumption patterns have
          led to an increase in waste generation. This creates environmental and social challenges for waste
          management.Poor segregation of waste at source, leading to improper disposal of
          hazardous and e-waste.Waste management facilities need to be developed and
          decentralized. There is also a lack of financial and technical resources, skills and competencies to improve
          waste management services.Poor waste management practices contribute to various
          forms of environmental pollution, such as air, water, soil and noise pollution. They also emit greenhouse
          gases that contribute to global warming and climate change. Improper waste management can have negative impacts on the society
          and economy, such as causing disease, fire, explosion, flooding or landslides; harming animals that
          consume waste unknowingly; affecting economic development such as through diminished tourism; losing
          valuable resources that could be reused or recycled; and inadequate recognition and integration of the
          informal sector
