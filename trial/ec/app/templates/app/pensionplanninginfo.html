      <h2 class="card-title">Chanllenges faced by the council </h2>
      <p class="card-text">The council encounters numerous challenges in delivering pension support for elderly citizens, ranging from financial constraints to demographic shifts. Budget limitations pose a significant hurdle, as the council must allocate limited resources to meet the growing demand for pension benefits amidst competing priorities. Additionally, ensuring equitable access to pension support for all elderly citizens, including those in underserved communities or with limited mobility, requires proactive outreach efforts and targeted interventions. Moreover, demographic aging exacerbates the strain on pension systems, as a larger proportion of the population reaches retirement age, placing greater pressure on pension funds and resources. Furthermore, navigating complex administrative procedures and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements adds to the administrative burden of administering pension programs. Addressing these challenges demands strategic planning, innovative solutions, and collaborative efforts to ensure that elderly citizens receive the support they need to enjoy a secure and dignified retirement.</p>
