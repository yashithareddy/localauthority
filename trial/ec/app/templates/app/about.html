                    Hyderabad, nestled in the southern part of India, is a city that boasts a rich tapestry of culture and history. It sits majestically on the Deccan Plateau, its landscape varying from rocky terrains to fertile plains, with the Musi River meandering through its heart. Founded in 1591 by Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, Hyderabad served as the capital of the Qutb Shahi dynasty and later became the seat of power for the Nizams, who ruled as a princely state under the suzerainty of the Mughal Empire.
